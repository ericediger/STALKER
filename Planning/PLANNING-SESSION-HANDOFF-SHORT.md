# PLANNING-SESSION-HANDOFF-SHORT

**Read `STALKER_MASTER-PLAN.md` first.** It has everything: epics, sessions, dependencies, strategic decisions, risk register.

**Ready to execute:** SESSION-1-PLAN.md + SESSION-1-KICKOFF.md

**Sessions 2–9:** Described in master plan but need detailed PLAN + KICKOFF files. Write one session ahead, after reviewing the prior session's report.

**Key rule:** Strategic decisions in the master plan are final unless explicitly revisited.
