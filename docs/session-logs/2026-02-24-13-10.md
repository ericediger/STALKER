# Session Log — 2026-02-24 13:10

## Summary

Completed Session 10 wrap-up: finished document updates (AGENTS.md, STALKER_MASTER-PLAN.md), wrote the session report, committed all changes, and pushed 4 commits to origin. This is a continuation of the earlier Session 10 execution which implemented data integrity fixes, bulk transaction paste, CI pipeline, and performance benchmarking.

## Changes Made

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Updated test count (469 → 506), session date |
| `Planning/STALKER_MASTER-PLAN.md` | Added Sessions 8–10 to tracker, updated risk register (R-6 resolved), added lessons learned (L-7, L-8), updated test progression chart, marked critical path complete |
| `Session Reports/260224_SESSION-10-REPORT.md` | NEW — Full session report with all 10 exit criteria verified |
| `Planning/SESSION-9-KICKOFF.md` | Moved from root (file reorganization) |
| `Planning/SESSION-9-PLAN.md` | Moved from root (file reorganization) |
| `SESSION-10-KICKOFF.md` | Added to version control |
| `SESSION-10-PLAN.md` | Added to version control |

Note: CLAUDE.md, HANDOFF.md, and KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md were updated in the earlier part of this session.

## Key Decisions

- **Master plan finalized:** All 10 sessions marked complete. No remaining critical path items.
- **Lessons learned captured:** L-7 (post-MVP hardening is high-value) and L-8 (zero scope cuts across 10 sessions) added to master plan.
- **Risk R-6 upgraded to resolved:** Benchmark at 147ms with transactional rebuild confirms performance is not a concern.

## Issues & Blockers

- None. All exit criteria met. All documents updated. All commits pushed.
- Two untracked items intentionally excluded: `.claude/` (internal state) and root-level `STALKER_MASTER-PLAN.md` (duplicate of Planning/ version).

## Next Steps

1. **Live API key wiring** — Symbol search, manual quote refresh, historical price backfill (top post-MVP priority)
2. **Holiday/half-day market calendar** — Reduce wasted API calls
3. **Advisor context window management** — Token counting, summary generation
4. **Responsive refinements** — Tablet/mobile layout
